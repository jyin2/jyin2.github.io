Hey guys! Hope you had a wonderful summer! We are planning on having a Cookie Dough Bakesale on hopefully the 14th and 15th of October. We are going hoping to have a variety of different types of cookie dough. I will be discussing with Mr. Murphy to land these two days next Monday. In the meantime, everyone fill out the google form below and choose a type of cookie dough to make that has NO RAW EGGS. We will have preset options in the google form but you can also email me at johnyin596@gmail.com if you want to make a particular type of cookie dough. Remember this is a 2 DAY bake sale. Have a nice weekend Core Olympiaders!
